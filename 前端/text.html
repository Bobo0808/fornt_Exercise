    Fake words are simply made up words that appear to be real, but actually don't exist and don't have any meaning.
    They initially appear real because they can be pronounced which makes it seem like they would be real words. This
    leads to the question of why in the world would anyone needs to find fake words or use a fake word generator? It
    does seem a bit strange at first, but there are actually a number of legitimate reasons why people find this free
    nonsense word tool useful. Below we list a few of the more common reasons that people might want to generate random
    pseudo words.
